==Formation of the Universe==
{{main|Timeline of the Big Bang}}

*13,600-13,500 Ma: First stars begin to shine
* 13,200 Ma: age of the oldest known star in the galaxy, [[HE 1523-0901]].

* 12,700 Ma: age of the [[quasar]] [[CFHQS 1641+3755]]
* 9,000 Ma: Earliest [[Population I]], or Sunlike stars.

==The earliest Solar System==
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Nebular hypothesis}}
In the earliest solar system history, the sun, the [[planetesimal]]s and the [[gas giant|jovian planets]] were formed. The inner solar system aggregated more slowly than the outer, so the terrestrial planets were not yet formed, including [[Earth]] and [[Moon]].
*c. 4,570 Ma: A [[supernova]] explosion seeds our galactic neighborhood with [[heavy element]]s that will be incorporated into the Earth, and results in a [[shock wave]] in a dense region of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. The [[Ca-Al-rich inclusions]], which formed 2 million years before the [[chondrules]],<ref>Amelin,Yuri, Alexander N. Krot, Ian D. Hutcheon, & Alexander A. Ulyanov (Sept 2002), "Lead Isotopic Ages of Chondrules and Calcium-Aluminum-Rich Inclusions" (Science, 6 September 2002: Vol. 297. no. 5587, pp. 1678 - 1683)</ref> are a key signature of a [[supernova]] explosion. 
*4,567±3 Ma: Rapid collapse of [[hydrogen]] [[molecular cloud]], forming a third-generation [[Population I star]], the [[Sun]], in a region of the [[Galactic Habitable Zone]] (GHZ), about 25,000 light years from the center of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].<ref>According to [http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html isotopicAges], the Ca-Al-I's (= [[Ca-Al-rich inclusion]]s) here formed in a [[proplyd]] (= protoplanetary disk]).</ref>
*4,566±2 Ma: A [[protoplanetary disc]] (from which Earth eventually forms) emerges around the young [[Sun]], which is in its [[T Tauri star|T Tauri]] stage.
*4,560–4550 Ma: Proto-Earth forms at the outer (cooler) edge of the [[habitable zone]] of the [[Solar System]]. At this stage the [[solar constant]] of the sun was only about 73% of its current value, but liquid water may have existed on the surface of the Proto-earth, probably due to the [[greenhouse effect|greenhouse warming]] of high levels of [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] present in the atmosphere.

==Hadean Eon==
{{main|Hadean}}
*4,533 Ma: Hadean Eon, [[Precambrian]] Supereon and [[Cryptic era]] start as the [[Earth]]–[[Moon]] system forms, possibly as a result of a glancing collision between proto–Earth and the hypothetical [[protoplanet]] [[Theia (planet)|Theia]]. (The Earth was considerably smaller than now, before this impact.) This impact vaporized a large amount of the crust, and sent material into orbit around Earth, which lingered as rings for a few million years, until these rings condensed into the Moon. The Moon geology [[pre-Nectarian]] period starts. Earth was covered by a [[magma]]tic ocean {{convert|200|km|mi}} deep resulting from the impact energy from this and other [[planetesimal]]s during the [[early bombardment phase]], and energy released by the [[planetary core]] forming. Outgassing from crustal rocks gives Earth a [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere of [[methane]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[ammonia]], and [[water vapour]], with lesser amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], then [[carbon dioxide]]. With further full outgassing over 1000–1500 K, nitrogen and ammonia become lesser constituents, and comparable amounts of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and hydrogen are released. 
*4,450 Ma: 100 million years after the Moon formed, the [[Geology of the Moon|first lunar crust]], formed of lunar [[anorthosite]], differentiates from lower [[magma]]s. The earliest Earth crust probably forms similarly out of similar material. On Earth the [[pluvial]] period starts, in which the Earth's crust cools enough to let oceans form.
*4,404 Ma: First known [[mineral]], found at [[Jack Hills]] in [[Western Australia]]. [[detritus|Detrital]] [[zircon]]s show presence of a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[liquid]] [[water]]. Latest possible date for a [[secondary atmosphere]] to form, produced by the Earth's crust [[outgassing]], reinforced by water and possibly [[organic molecule]]s delivered by [[comet]] impacts and [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s (including type [[carbonaceous chondrite#CI group|CI]] shown to be high in a number of [[amino acids]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH)).
*4,150 Ma: Unofficial [[Basin Groups]] Era starts.

Jeffrey (2006), "Wandering Gas Giants and Lunar Bombardment: Outward migration of Saturn might have triggered a dramatic increase in the bombardment rate on the Moon 3.9 billion years ago, an idea testable with lunar samples" [http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug06/cataclysmDynamics.html]</ref>
